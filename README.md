## Abstract

In search of new contrast mechanisms, the Grueneisen relaxation photoacoustic mi- croscopy (GR-PAM) emerged in the field of photoacoustic microscopy.
In this thesis the underlaying effect, where the amplitude of the photoacoustic pressure wave changes due to a preheating, is proven. Furthermore, a comparison of GR-PAM to conventional optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) is done. Additionally, a compact version of an optical ultrasonic transducer, based on a Fabry–P ́erot interferometer, is constructed and built.
